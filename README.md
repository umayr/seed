## What?
This is super minimal nodejs seed to kickstart any project.

## How?
```bash
$ mkdir my-project && cd $_
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umayr/seed/master/clone.sh)

# or the other way
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umayr/seed/master/clone.sh) path/to/project
```

## Contribute?
Hell, yes. This repository intends to seed not only any bare minimal project but extended either web-based (express, restify) or CLI based applications. If you have some free time and clear structure for any aforementioned application you may send a pull request.
